The new version "1.2.0" of mvvmFX was released.

We have received lots of feedback for the new beta features of our last release,
especially for the *ModelWrapper* and the *Commands*.
Therefore this release mainly contains improvements for these two features.

#### Commands

- The `Command` interface now has a `progress` property similar to the *progress* property of JavaFX's `Task` class.
The DelegateCommand is now implemented as a subclass of `Service`. Instead of a 'Runnable' it now takes a 'Supplier<Action>'
as argument where `Action` is a subclass of `Task<Void>`.

- The 'Command' has now a property 'notExecutable' which is the negated version of 'executable'. This way binding to the 'disable' property of a Button is easier.

#### ModelWrapper

- In version 1.1.0 the ModelWrapper was creating fields of type `Property<String>`, `Property<Integer>`, `Property<Number>` and so on.
This makes databinding complicated. In the new release the type Ã¬s `StringProperty` and `IntegerProperty` etc. which will simplify data binding a lot.


#### Notifications

- It is now possible to send notifications directly from the ViewModel to the corresponding View
without using the global NotificationCenter.

- A bug was fixed where an observer was still registered after unsubscribe when the same observer instance was subscribed multiple times.
