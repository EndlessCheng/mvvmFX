This week we have released the **new version 1.0.0** of **mvvmFX**.

With the change to version 1.0.0 we like to express our opinion that the library is finally ready
for production. It was a big desire over the last few releases to stabilize the API and improve the documentation and examples.


### Changes

There is only a limited number of [changes](https://github.com/sialcasa/mvvmFX/releases/tag/mvvmfx-1.0.0) this time.

Most notable is the change of the Maven artifact id. In the past we have used the artifact id "mvvmFX" (note uppercase "FX") which of course is wrong due to the [maven naming guidelines](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html). Now all artifact id's are lowercase. To use mvvmFX you now have to use this dependency definition:


        <dependency>
                <groupId>de.saxsys</groupId>
                <artifactId>mvvmfx</artifactId>
                <version>1.0.0</version>
        </dependency>


The second change is the renaming of method names of the [NotificationCenter](https://sialcasa.github.io/mvvmFX/javadoc/1.0.0/mvvmfx/de/saxsys/mvvmfx/utils/notifications/NotificationCenter.html) to match typical naming conventions for publish/subscribe systems. This is an API-breaking change but we think that it improves the usability of the class a lot.  


### Bugfixes

There are two bug fixes in this release. The first was `NullPointerException` for the case that an [FxmlView](https://sialcasa.github.io/mvvmFX/javadoc/1.0.0/mvvmfx/de/saxsys/mvvmfx/FxmlView.html) was placed in the *default package*.

The second bug was a problem with multiple instantiations of injected classes when using the Guice module.

You can see the full changelog at the [release section of github](https://github.com/sialcasa/mvvmFX/releases/tag/mvvmfx-1.0.0).

### Future

With the first stable release finished now we can work on more advanced features again. In the future we will take care of features that are needed for bigger applications. The first thing will be the support for [Scopes](https://github.com/sialcasa/mvvmFX/issues/154) to be able to build groups of related views.
