Today we have released a hotfix version 1.3.1.
In this release we are fixed two minor problems introduced in the last release 1.3.0.
The first problem was a testability issue due to thread handling of the publish/subscribe mechanism of ViewModels.
This was made simpler and a new `NotificationTestHelper` was introduced.

The second problem was an `IndexOutOfBoundException` when using the `getHighestMessage` method
of the `ValidationStatus` class inside of ChangeListeners on the `validProperty` or one of the observable lists of messages.

See the [release notes](https://github.com/sialcasa/mvvmFX/releases/tag/mvvmfx-1.3.1) for more details.
