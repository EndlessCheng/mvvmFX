Today we have released the version 1.4.0.
This release contains mostly improvements for existing features and bugfixes.
The details of the release can be found in the [github release notes](https://github.com/sialcasa/mvvmFX/releases/tag/mvvmfx-1.4.0).

The ModelWrapper now supports the mapping of Lists.
In the future we will further work on the ModelWrapper to support more complex models and other collections.

Another noteworthy improvement is the possibility to exchange the implementation of the NotificationCenter.
A nice use case for this is to use a mock implementation of the NotificationCenter in unit tests.
