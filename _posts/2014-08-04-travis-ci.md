title: "Cloud Continuous Integration and Snapshot deployment"

Since last week we are using the cloud continuous integration service [Travic-CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
to build the **mvvmFX** code on every commit pushed to github. This makes working on the
project more comfortable because we get an instant feedback when changes are made and new pull requests
are created.

Here you can view the current state of the build online: [https://travis-ci.org/sialcasa/mvvmFX](https://travis-ci.org/sialcasa/mvvmFX)

Additionally we have configured the build so that a new
[SNAPSHOT](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/de/saxsys/mvvmFX/0.3.0-SNAPSHOT/) is deployed to
the [Sonatype OSS maven repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/)
on every commit that arrives on the development branch of the project.
This way new features can be tested very quickly by our users.
