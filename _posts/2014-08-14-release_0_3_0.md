We are very proud to announce the release of the new version 0.3.0 of mvvmFX.

We have a bunch of interesting changes and new features. The most notable feature is probably the
new `FluentViewLoader`. This is a fluent API that can be used to load views instead of using the overloaded
methods of the old `ViewLoader`.

With this version we have dropped the support for Java 7. This makes the development of the framework easier because we can
profit from the new features of Java 8 like Lambdas. We think that most modern JavaFX projects
will use Java 8 anyway and most of the other useful frameworks like ControlsFX are requiring Java 8 too.

There are some API-breaking changes too. First of all we have moved our main classes and interfaces that are needed
to load Views into the package `de.saxsys.mvvmfx`. At the moment our framework is still in a beta state
and therefore API breaking changes are possible. But we are looking forward to stabilize the API in the future.

You can see the full changelog at the [release section of github](https://github.com/sialcasa/mvvmFX/releases/tag/mvvmFX-0.3.0).
