mvvmfx-guice-starter
========

This contains the startup code to run the example application with the dependency injection framework Guice and the mvvmfx extension
[mvvmfx-guice](https://github.com/sialcasa/mvvmFX/tree/develop/mvvmfx-parent/mvvmfx-guice).

The main code of the example is implemented in [mvvmfx-complex-example](https://github.com/sialcasa/mvvmFX/tree/develop/examples/mvvmfx-complex-example).

An alternative way to run the example application is to use CDI/Weld as dependency injection framework which can be seen in the
[mvvmfx-cdi-starter example](https://github.com/sialcasa/mvvmFX/tree/develop/examples/mvvmfx-cdi-starter).
